    <p>Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba <br>
      Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba <br>
      Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba <br>
      Ba-ba-ba-ba</p>
    <p>I think about that day <br>
      I left him at a Greyhound station <br>
      West of Santa FÃ©</p>
    <p>We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true <br>
      Still I did what I had to do <br>
      'Cause I just knew</p>
    <p>Summer Sunday nights <br>
      We'd sink into our seats <br>
      Right as they dimmed out all the lights <br>
      A Technicolor world made out of music and machine <br>
      It called me to be on that screen <br>
      And live inside each scene</p>
    <p>Without a nickel to my name <br>
      Hopped a bus, here I came <br>
      Could be brave or just insane</p>
    <p>We'll have to see</p>
    <p>'Cause maybe in that sleepy town <br>
      He'll sit one day, the lights are down <br>
      He'll see my face and think of how <br>
      He used to know me</p>
    <p>Climb these hills <br>
      I'm reaching for the heights <br>
      And chasing all the lights that shine (lights that shine) <br>
      And when they let you down (it's another day of)<br>
      You'll get up off the ground (it's another day of)<br>
      'Cause morning rolls around <br>
      And it's another day of sun</p>
    <p>I hear 'em every day <br>
      The rhythms in the canyons <br>
      That'll never fade away <br>
      The ballads in the barrooms <br>
      Left by those who came before  <br>
      They say "you gotta want it more" <br>
      So I bang on every door</p>
    <p>And even when the answer's "no"<br>
      Or when my money's running low <br>
      The dusty mic and neon glow <br>
      Are all I need</p>
    <p>And someday as I sing my song <br>
      A small-town kid'll come along</p>
    <p>That'll be the thing to push him on and go, go</p>
    <p>Climb these hills <br>
      I'm reaching for the heights <br>
      And chasing all the lights that shine (lights that shine) <br>
      And when they let you down (it's another day of)<br>
      You'll get up off the ground (it's another day of)<br>
      'Cause morning rolls around <br>
      And it's another day of sun</p>
    <p>And when they let you down <br>
      The morning rolls aroundo</p>
    <p>It's another day of sun (oh)<br>
      It's another day of sun (oh)<br>
      It's another day of sun (sun, sun, sun, sun)<br>
      It's just another day of sun (oh)<br>
      Just another day of sun (oh)<br>
      It's another day of sun (sun)<br>
      Another day has just begun (oh)<br>
      It's another day of sun</p>
    <p>It's another day of sun</p>
