    <p>We were so beautiful <br>
      We were so tragic <br>
      No other magic <br>
      Could ever compare</p>
    <p>I lost myself, seventeen <br>
      Then you came, found me <br>
      No other magic <br>
      Could ever compare</p>
    <p>There's a room <br>
      In my heart with the memories we made <br>
      Took 'em down but they're still in their frames <br>
      There's no way I could ever forget, hmm</p>
    <p>For as long as I live <br>
      And as long as I love <br>
      I will never not think about you <br>
      You, hmm <br>
      I will never not think about you</p>
    <p>From the moment I loved <br>
      I knew you were the one <br>
      And no matter whatever I do <br>
      Ooh, hmm <br>
      I will never not think about you</p>
    <p>What we had only comes <br>
      Once in a lifetime <br>
      For the rest of mine <br>
      Always compare</p>
    <p>To the room <br>
      In my heart with the memories we made <br>
      Nights on fifth, in between B and A <br>
      There's no way I could ever forget, hmm</p>
    <p>For as long as I live <br>
      And as long as I love <br>
      I will never not think about you <br>
      You, hmm <br>
      I will never not think about you</p>
    <p>From the moment I loved <br>
      I knew you were the one <br>
      And no matter whatever I do <br>
      Ooh, hmm <br>
      I will never not think about you</p>
    <p>Didn't we have fun? <br>
      Didn't we have fun, looking back? <br>
      Didn't we have fun? <br>
      Didn't we have fun?</p>
    <p>Didn't we have fun? <br>
      Didn't we have fun, looking back? <br>
      Didn't we have fun? <br>
      Didn't we have fun?</p>
    <p>We were so beautiful <br>
      We were so tragic <br>
      No other magic <br>
      Could ever compare</p>
